# Logic-Program-Insurance-Contracts-Hackathon
Test cases are in made Prolog language because we made our code in Prolog first, then adapted it to EpiLog, to achieve evidence of correctness our adaptation needs to be confirmed as valid. To prove our test cases work we will also post our Prolog code here in case you're interested in testing these cases.

As for our reasoning, we defined clauses by reading the pdf relating to our contract and extracting sentences with conditions which would invalidate either the contract or the specific claim made.
